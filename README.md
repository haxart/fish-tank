Random:

1. ~~I kind of want to make a CSS animation of bubbles that bubble up and disapear every few seconds.~~

2. Turn that stupid fish around so he doesnt swim backwards.


CSS:

1. Make .fish css class more modular.  It should apply general movement/structure to an element without being exclusive.  This allows for a second class that declares type of fish. Ex: class="fish salmon"

2. Find cooler skins for second fish

3. Decide whether bubbles should be done in CSS or JS.  JS would be nice if I can come up with a solution that doesnt drain CPU.  CSS works nicely but creates a ton of markup/styles :(


JS:

1. Object validations and consistency needs to be addressed.  JS needs to keep track of original fish and count id+1 for all clones.  No duplicate ID's.

2. Handler for children so that any clone is clickable, not just the master.

3. Random species generator.  Make every sibling clickable/mutate-able to generate a random species upon click.
